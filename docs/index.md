# oncoexporter


Oncoexporter is a Python package that supports extract transform load (ETL)
operations for patient data in translational research on oncology.
Input data from sources such as Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) are
transformed into collections of
[GA4GH Phenopackets](https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema){:target="\_blank"}.

The source code is available in the oncoexporter [GitHub repository](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/oncoexporter).
